# Mediator - The Bot

A moderation Discord made with following goals in mind:
- Fully leverage Discord's interaction API
- Utilise in built moderation features provided by Discord for seamless moderation
- Attempts to automate chat moderation using ML (I will try to incorporate this using Google's [Perspective Comment Analyser API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/))
- Clean user interface (at least my best attempts)
- Low latency responses
- Localization support (Not yet decided tbh, will just be building the framework for this)
- And maybe more stuff... âœ¨

## How to use the bot:
Since the bot is primarily interaction based, you can use the bot using Slash Commands!

You can also use the bot through context menus. (**Desktop Only** as of now)
